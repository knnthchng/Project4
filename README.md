# Machine Learning Analysis of Employee Burnout 

Collaborated with Menard Cayabyab, Sohaib Khan, Clair Dean

## Project Background
In this project, we are using Machine Learning to analyze employee burnout and the various factors that lead to burnout and the long term effects of burnout categorized into various themes such as gender, company type, resource allocation, etc. The main questions being analyzed through this project about employee burnout are:

- What factors correlate more strongly with burnout?
- Are there any correlations among burnout factors?
- How effectively can we predict burnout (with this data and ML)?

## Project Contents
This project is reliant on visualizations created primarily through Tableau and Pandas to showcase data collected and to present the trends and graphs that correlate to the primary questions being answered through this project. The contents of the this project consist of and are not limited to:

- Machine Learning .ipynb which runs our dataset at approx 92% accuracy rate with visualizations corresponding to burnout factors in scatterplot, bar graph, and heatmap
- Survey made in .html which better gauges burnout with questions relating to the burnout factors mentioned above
- Tableau and Jupyter/Colab notebooks showcasing various visualizations which halp correlate burnout factors and their relationships with each other. 

## Visualizations
Visualizations are primarily created through Tableau and Pandas and highlight various factors and their correlation to burnout. The factors analyzed consist of:

- Average Burnout Rate vs Resource Allocation (Bar Graph)
- Burnout by Seniority (Triple Bar Graph)
- Burnout by Gender (Table)
- Mental Fatigue Score (Scatterplot/Histogram)
- Resource Allocation (Histogram)
- Burnout Factors (Heatmap)

## Analysis/Presentation
The main takeaways from the visualizations created in this project all correspond heavily to employee burnout being very prevalent amongst the factors found in the workplace. Using the heatmap, we can come to the conclusion that designation and mental fatigue are the strongest factors that lead to burnout while resource allocation and WFH setup are weaker factors. Also, the scatter plot and histogram shows that mental fatigue has the strongest positive correlation to burnout with the score trending upward at the steepest angle also indicating faster rise in burnout due to mental fatigue. Other aspects like resource allocation and seniority show a steady rise through the bar graphs but not as strong of a correlation as the other factors. The survey will provide a greater understanding in real time of factors correlating to burnout when it is administered during the presentation slide deck.
